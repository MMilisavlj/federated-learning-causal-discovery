##  Overview  
This repository contains the implementation and results of my Bachelor Thesis:  
**"Causal AI in Federated Learning for ESG Data Causal Analysis"**.  

The project investigates whether **synthetic data** generated by clients can be used to infer reliable **global causal graphs** in a **federated learning setting**, while preserving data privacy.  

---

##  Motivation  
Organizations often hold sensitive datasets (legal, political, ESG-related) that cannot be shared directly due to **privacy and compliance regulations** (e.g., GDPR). Traditional centralized causal discovery methods require pooling data, which is often not feasible.  

This thesis explores an alternative:  
1. **Clients generate synthetic data locally** (using GMM or CGNN).  
2. **Synthetic datasets are sent to the server** instead of raw data.  
3. The server runs **causal discovery** to infer a **global causal graph**.

##  Methods  

### Synthetic Data Generation  
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** statistical approximation of real data distributions.  
- **Causal Generative Neural Networks (CGNN):** neural generative approach trained with Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss.  

### Causal Discovery  
- **LiNGAM** (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) used for graph inference.  
- **Post-hoc pruning** (threshold = 0.1) to remove weak/noisy edges.  

### Evaluation Metrics  
- **Structural Hamming Distance (SHD):** difference in graph structure.  
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score:** edge-level evaluation.  
- **Kolmogorov–Smirnov test (K-S):** preprocessing check for IID assumptions.

##  Results  

| Method / Setting                  | SHD | Precision | Recall | F1   |
|-----------------------------------|-----|-----------|--------|------|
| Centralized (raw data baseline)   | 20  | 0.231     | 0.188  | 0.207|
| Federated (real data)             | 20  | 0.231     | 0.188  | 0.207|
| Federated + **GMM** synthetic     | 23  | 0.333     | 0.250  | 0.286|
| Federated + **CGNN** synthetic    | 25  | 0.091     | 0.063  | 0.074|

- **GMM** produced the best trade-off between fidelity and privacy.  
- **CGNN** underperformed in federated, small-sample settings (sensitive to noise, high compute demand).  
- Lesson: **simpler, robust models often outperform complex ones under constraints**.  

---

##  Key Insights
- Federated causal discovery is possible **without sharing raw data**.  
- Synthetic data quality is **crucial** for downstream causal inference.  
- Trade-offs exist between **privacy, fidelity, compute cost, and dataset size**.  
- Evaluation must be **evidence-driven, not just qualitative**.  

---

##  Future Work
- Explore **differential privacy mechanisms** for additional guarantees.  
- Test on **larger, more diverse datasets**.  
- Investigate **hybrid generators** (e.g., VAEs, diffusion models).  
- Integrate into **federated causal discovery frameworks** for real-world deployment.
